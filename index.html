    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>
        I’m Maia Racho, a design student in my final year of college in De LaSalle-Saint Benilde. Art has always been where I feel most at home, and studying design has given me the chance to explore different ways of expressing ideas—from sketching and illustration to digital layouts and typography.
    </p>

    <p>
        I initially wanted to take an animation course, then I decided that I would take multimedia arts instead. I want to acquire an extensive set of skills that can be utilized in the real world—when I get out of college.
    </p>

    <p>
        My work tends to lean into cartoons, as well as storytelling and atmosphere. I like creating pieces that feel like they belong to a bigger world, something that makes people pause for a second. As I move forward, I’m excited to keep pushing myself, experimenting with new mediums, and shaping a style that feels true to me. I hope to inspire others with my creativity and make the world a better place using art.
    </p>


    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <p>Below are examples of my past works from my college course. There is a wide variety of mediums, from traditional drawings to film-making to 3d modelling.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a self portrait that we were asked to do to introduce ourselves to our blockmates. I drew myself with a book because I love to read, and the stars above my head because I just have this unexplainable love for the stars.</p>
